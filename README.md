# Quantum-Well
One-dimensional quantum well based on solution of stationary Schrodinger equation. <br/>
The bisection algorithm finds zero energy points. <br/>
This repository includes 6 '.txt' and 3 '.png' files with values for different sizes of quantum well. <br/>
"Fun.txt" and "Zero.txt" are for values: A=2.0, V0=10.0 <br/>
"Fun2.txt" and "Zero2.txt" are for values: A=10.0, V0=2.0 <br/>
"Fun3.txt" and "Zero3.txt" are for values:  A=5.0, V0=5.0 <br/>
